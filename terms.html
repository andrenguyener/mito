                All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without
                limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</br>
                6. Changes</br>
                We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we
                will try to provide at least 30 (change this) days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes
                a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</br>
